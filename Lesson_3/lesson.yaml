- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Rename the height_ft and mass_lbs columns in starwars to height and mass using a pipe and rename().
  CorrectAnswer: starwars <- starwars %>% rename(height = height_ft, mass = mass_lbs)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='starwars <- starwars %>% rename(height = height_ft, mass = mass_lbs)')
  Hint: Hint- ?rename to see what arguments to input. Should have two lines of code, the first line with a pipe from starwars data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the types of different species in the starwars data using the unique() function.
  CorrectAnswer: unique(starwars$species)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='unique(starwars$species)')
  Hint: Hint- ?unique to see what function does. Did you use the $ operator with starwars to select species?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use filter() in a piped expression from the starwars data to create a new dataset called droid_data with only droids.
  CorrectAnswer: droid_data <- starwars %>% filter(species == "Droid")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='droid_data <- starwars %>% filter(species == "Droid")')
  Hint: Hint- ?filter to see what arguments to input. Should have two lines of code, the first line with a pipe from starwars data. Did you assign the new dataset the correct name? Did you use '==' to filter species to droid?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Determine the average mass of droids.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(droid_data$mass)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(droid_data$mass)')
  Hint: Hint- Did you use mean() on the new droid dataset on the mass variable?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Determine the standard deviation of the mass of droids using sd().
  CorrectAnswer: sd(droid_data$mass)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sd(droid_data$mass)')
  Hint: Hint- Did you use sd() on the new droid dataset on the mass variable?
