- Class: text
  Output: You and your neighbor started a friendly fishing competition. You want to keep track of the fish you each catch to keep things fair.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a vector called days of the days of week you both fished (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). 
  CorrectAnswer: days <- c("Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='days <- c("Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")')
  Hint: Hint- Did you use quotes for character arguments and capitalize in the right places?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a vector of the fish you caught, called my_fish. You caught 2 fish the first 2 days and 3 the rest of the days.
  CorrectAnswer: my_fish <- c(2, 2, 3, 3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_fish <- c(2, 2, 3, 3)')
  Hint: Hint- did you name the vector correctly and have a value for all 4 days you fished?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a vector of the fish your neighbor caught, called neigh_fish. He caught 0 fish the first day, 1 fish the next day, and 4 the rest of the days.
  CorrectAnswer: neigh_fish <- c(0, 1, 4, 4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='neigh_fish <- c(0, 1, 4, 4)')
  Hint: Hint- did you name the vector correctly and have a value for all 4 days fished?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Make a data frame called fish_df combining the days fished, your fish caught, and your neighbor's fish caught. Name each variable the same as the vector names.
  CorrectAnswer: fish_df <- data.frame(days = days, my_fish = my_fish, neigh_fish = neigh_fish)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fish_df <- data.frame(days = days, my_fish = my_fish, neigh_fish = neigh_fish)')
  Hint: Hint- did you use data.frame(), input the variables in order, and name them?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The days you fished is a categorical variable, so change the class of days to factor in your data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: fish_df$days <- as.factor(fish_df$days)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fish_df$days <- as.factor(fish_df$days)')
  Hint: Hint- did you use as.factor() and the $ symbol to select the days variable from fish_df?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the df[ , ] syntax, select the cell of the fish_df that has the number of fish your neighbor caught on Thursday.
  CorrectAnswer: fish_df[2, 3]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fish_df[2, 3]')
  Hint: Hint- did you select the correct row and column number and have them in the correct order?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the sum function and the greater than operator, write an expression using the variables in fish_df to determine if you caught the most fish.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(fish_df$my_fish) > sum(fish_df$neigh_fish)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(fish_df$my_fish) > sum(fish_df$neigh_fish)')
  Hint: Hint- did you use the $ symbol to select the my_fish and neigh_fish variables from fish_df? Are the arguments in the correct order?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Your neighbor thinks it's more fair to determine the winner by the the average of fish caught per day. Determine if you caught more fish on average than your neighbor using mean().
  CorrectAnswer: mean(fish_df$my_fish) > mean(fish_df$neigh_fish)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(fish_df$my_fish) > mean(fish_df$neigh_fish)')
  Hint: Hint- did you use the mean function on both the my_fish and neigh_fish variables in fish_df? Did you set up your '>' expression correctly?
